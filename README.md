# Hands-On DevOps on Azure
This project contains the updated source code that is provided by Microsoft during the DevOps project creation on Microsoft Azure. 

### Course contents
In this course we explore what Azure DevOps project offers to DevOps teams, and we take a critical look at the areas where Azure DevOps project is a viable replacement of on-prem solutions. We explore:

1. Version control services.
2. Pipelines (integration, delivery, deployment).
3. Agents (hosted, self-managed including Azure VMs as needed).
4. Azure App Service and DevOps&mdash;especially Deployment Slots for Zero Downtime.
5. Monitoring and patching.
6. Security and user roles.
7. Notification and required human-intervention.

We explore the key areas of DevOps environment in this course and show-case how to implement them in Azure DevOps project. Although DevOps being a huge topic, we try to explain from the initials to a fully automated pipeline of a code-to-production cycle. 

### How to run
